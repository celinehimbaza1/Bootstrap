Bootstrap 5

=======



Bootstrap is the most popular HTML,CSS and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first website.



Get Started

=======

Bootstrap is a free frontend framework for faster and easier web development.  It was developed by Marc Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter in August 2011

Why Bootstrap?

=========

1.Easy to use: Any body with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using B.

2.Responsive features: Websites are automatically responsive to phones, tablets and desktops.

3.Mobile first approacH

4.Browser compatibility: Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Opera. If you use Internet Explorer you will need to use B3 or B4.



Ways of Get B.

1.Using CDN (Content Delivery Network): Directly Add few lines of code to link CSS and bootstrap.

2.Download B5 from getbootstrap.com

Here we will use CDN because is fast easy to use, No file management(no need to keep updating B) and it reduce server load.

We will need to provide these few codes:



<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>

.container:

The .container class provide a responsive fixed width container

.container-fluid:

The .container-fluid class provides a full width container,spanning the entire width of viewport



Container Padding

By default, containers have left and right padding, with no top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-5 means "add a large top padding":

examples:

<div class="container p-5 my-5 border"></div>

<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-dark text-white"></div>

<div class="container p-5 my-5 bg-primary text-white"></div>



Bootstrap 5 Grid System

================

Bootstrap's grid system is built with flexbox and allows up to 12 columns across the page.

If you do not want to use all 12 columns individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns.

The grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange automatically depending on the screen size.

Make sure that the sum adds up to 12 or fewer (it is not required that you use all 12 available columns).



Grid Classes

The Bootstrap 5 grid system has six classes:

.col- (extra small devices - screen width less than 576px)

.col-sm- (small devices - screen width equal to or greater than 576px)

.col-md- (medium devices - screen width equal to or greater than 768px)

.col-lg- (large devices - screen width equal to or greater than 992px)

.col-xl- (xlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1200px)

.col-xxl- (xxlarge devices - screen width equal to or greater than 1400px)

The classes above can be combined to create more dynamic and flexible layouts.

Tip: Each class scales up, so if you want to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm.



Bootstrap 5 Text/Typography

===================

By default B5 uses a font-size of 1 rem (16px by default) and its line-height is 1.5.

In addition all <p> has a default margin-top of 0 and margin-bottom of 1 rem.



Colors

====

Bootstrap 5 has some contextual classes that can be used to provide "meaning through colors".

The classes for text colors are: .text-muted, .text-primary, .text-success, .text-info, .text-warning, .text-danger, .text-secondary, .text-white, .text-dark, .text-body (default body color/often black) and .text-light



Background colors

===========

The classes for background colors are: .bg-primary, .bg-success, .bg-info, .bg-warning, .bg-danger, .bg-secondary, .bg-dark and .bg-light.
